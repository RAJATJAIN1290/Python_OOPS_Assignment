    "# Python OOPs Questions and Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and methods. It promotes code reuse, modularity, and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a class in OOP?\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods that the created objects will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with state (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
    "- Abstraction- hides implementation details and shows only essential features to the user.\n",
    "- Encapsulation- hides the internal state of an object using access modifiers and restricts direct access to some components.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "Dunder (double underscore) methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__len__`, and `__repr__` allow objects to interact with Python’s built-in functions and operators in custom ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
    "Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent). It helps in reusability and establishing a hierarchical classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the same method to behave differently based on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "Encapsulation is achieved by:\n",
    "- Using single `_` or double `__` underscore to make variables/methods private or protected.\n",
    "- Providing getter and setter methods to access/modify private variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "A constructor is a special method named `__init__` that is called when an object is instantiated. It initializes the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
    "- `@classmethod`: Takes `cls` as the first parameter and can modify class state.\n",
    "- `@staticmethod`: Does not take `self` or `cls`; behaves like a regular function inside a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is method overloading in Python?\n",
    "Python doesn't support traditional method overloading. Instead, it uses default arguments or `*args`, `**kwargs` to achieve similar functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
    "The `@property` decorator turns a method into a getter, allowing you to access it like an attribute. Useful for computed properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
    "It enhances flexibility and maintainability by allowing one interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
    "An abstract class cannot be instantiated. It can define abstract methods that must be implemented in derived classes. Use `abc.ABC` and `@abstractmethod`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
    "- Code reusability through inheritance\n",
    "- Encapsulation for data protection\n",
    "- Abstraction to hide complexity\n",
    "- Polymorphism for flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "- **Class variable**: Shared by all instances of a class.\n",
    "- **Instance variable**: Unique to each instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
    "A class can inherit from more than one parent class. Python uses the MRO (Method Resolution Order) to resolve conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python\n",
    "- `__str__`: Returns a readable string representation (used by `print()`).\n",
    "- `__repr__`: Returns an official string representation (used in debugging).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?\n",
    "`super()` is used to call a method from the parent class. Commonly used in constructors to ensure parent initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?\n",
    "The `__del__` method is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed, typically for cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
    "- `@staticmethod`: No access to class or instance; used for utility functions.\n",
    "- `@classmethod`: Has access to the class (`cls`) and can modify class state.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
    "Python uses dynamic method resolution. If a subclass overrides a method from a parent, the subclass version is called when the method is invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
    "Method chaining returns `self` from each method so multiple methods can be called on the same object in one line.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "obj.set_name(\"John\").set_age(30).save()\n"
